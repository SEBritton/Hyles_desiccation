# Hyles_desiccation
Dissertation chapter on the melanin desiccation hypothesis in Hyles lineata larvae. 
This chapter is now published in the Journal of Insect Physiology: "No evidence for the melanin desiccation hypothesis in a larval lepidopteran."

Included in this project are three data sets and an R file that can replicate all the analyses. Also included are all the images of larvae used for image analysis. Finally, the output plots used in the publication are included.
